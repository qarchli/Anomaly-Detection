# Anomaly-Detection
<p>This is an implementation of anomaly detection algorithm using the gaussian distribution inspired from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera.</p>
<p>We start this exercise by using a small dataset that is easy to visualize (Part 1), then we'll move to a high dimensional dataset (Part 2).</p>
<p>
    Part 1 example case consists of 2 network server statistics across several machines: the latency and throughput of each machine.

<p>
    Part 2 example case consists of several network server statistics across several machines.
</p>
<p>
This exercise will help us find possibly faulty (or very fast) machines.
